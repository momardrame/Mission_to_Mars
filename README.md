Robin is putting together this web-scraping project. Being able to get the latest news and 
updates with the click of a button? That’s a really useful tool for someone who wants 
to keep up with the Mission to Mars.

To accomplish this she would have to extract and display information from all over the 
web and display it in a centralized location by pulling data from multiple websites, 
store it in a database, then present the collected data in a central location:a webpage.
An Web App would  be build to scrape data everytime it is required with a click of a mouse
